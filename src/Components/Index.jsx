                An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopædia (British

                by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and
                searchable.[4] Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed
                than those in most dictionaries.[3][5] Generally speaking,
                encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning
                the subject named in the article's title;[5] this is unlike
                dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about

                grammatical forms.[5][6][7][8][9] Encyclopedias have existed for
                around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that
                time as regards language (written in a major international or a
                vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent

                Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang
                attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of
                the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
                An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopædia (British
                English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries
                of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or
                discipline.[1][2] Encyclopedias are divided into articles or
                entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name[3] or
                by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and
                searchable.[4] Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed
                than those in most dictionaries.[3][5] Generally speaking,
                encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning
                the subject named in the article's title;[5] this is unlike
                dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about
                words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and
                grammatical forms.[5][6][7][8][9] Encyclopedias have existed for
                around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that
                time as regards language (written in a major international or a
                vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent
                (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge),
                cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic,
                utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership
                (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the
                technologies available for their production and distribution
                (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet).
                As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts,
                printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools
                and other educational institutions.
